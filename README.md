***NOTE:** "This tool has always been developed for my personal use in mind, therefore the focus has always been Linux first as I run them on my home and cloud servers before making it available to the general public."*

## Overview üìö
**Income Generator** is an all-in-one tool that consolidates a variety of supported applications, enabling users to generate passive income by leveraging everyday devices and unused internet bandwidth.

By seamlessly integrating these applications, simplifying the entire process, making it more efficient and accessible with applications auto-updating.

Some of the key features you can expect:
- **Easy To Use** - All-in-one solution for managing the stack. Docker installation, start/stop/remove.
- **Multi-platform** - Deploy across different OS (Windows to come later).
- **Global Access** - Access the tool anywhere, just type `igm`.
- **Auto update** - Ensures applications always running up-to-date.
- **Resource Limit** - Easily apply resource limit based on system hardware.

üìñ Visit the [Wiki](../../wiki) for more details and in-depth instructions.

## Getting Started üö•
### Prerequisite üì¶
**Everything the tool configures to run will be under a containerised virtualised environment isolated from the host.**

- The tool works best on a 64-bit machine, though it is still possible to run it under a 32-bit operating system (OS), but will will come with certain performance limitations, specifically with lower memory availability.
- A minimum of 4GB would be best recommended to ensure the most resource available and for future expansions.
- The stack requires **Docker** and **Compose** to operate as everything is running in a containerised environment and easily managed.
- For ARM architecture devices, such as Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon etc, will be required to install an emulation layer such as **[qemu-user-static (qus)](https://github.com/dbhi/qus)** to run x86 architecture on ARM. This can be easily enabled via the Docker container.

### Quick Start Guide ‚öôÔ∏è
Assuming **Docker** and **Compose** is already pre-installed (Can also be installed from the tool):

:warning: *Newer versions of Docker integrate Compose directly. Accessed as `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.*

**1.** Open the terminal and clone the project.
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/XternA/income-generator.git ~/.income-generator
```
**2.** Add to path then source the shell file for global access.
```sh
# To find out which shell the terminal is using
echo $SHELL

# If shell is bash
echo "alias igm='(cd ~/.income-generator; sh start.sh)'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# If shell is zsh
echo "alias igm='(cd ~/.income-generator; sh start.sh)'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
**3.** Register an account for each application in the **[applications table](#app-compatibility-)**.
**4.** Run the tool via the alias or within the folder.
```sh
# Just type anywhere in the shell
igm

# If prefer to run from within the tool folder
cd ~/.income-generator
sh start.sh
```
**5.** Follow the setup configuration which will have comments regarding configuration tips.
```
1. Install & Run Applications
2. Setup Configuration
3. Start Applications
4. Stop Applications
...
Select an option (1-9):
```
**6.** Select choice 1 to install, then pick accordingly to install based on what IP address the device is connected to.
```
1. Only applications with VPS/Hosting support
2. All applications including residential IPs only support
3. All applications including residential IPs only support, excluding single instances only
4. Applications with unlimited counts

Select an option (1-4):
```
**6.** Start earning passively. üí∏

## App Compatibility üìã
Using the table below, each app can identify its total install count per IP type. This indicates which stack option to run in the **'Install & Run Applications'** option of the tool.

Each app has been grouped in the install option. Therefore, whether it be residential or hosting already installed in the same network, you can install it on another device within the same network using the selective choice. The tool will install all the apps that meet the conditions below.

## Tested Environments ‚úÖ
The docker stack should work on anything that may have docker installed. In particular, it has been tested on:

| Windows WSL2 (x86_64 / amd64) | Linux Ubuntu (x86_64 / amd64) | Raspbian OS (arm32/64) | MacOS Intel (x86_64) | MacOS Apple Silicon (arm64) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| :red_circle: | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :yellow_circle: | :yellow_circle: |
| Desktop / Laptop | Desktop / Laptop | Raspberry Pi 3/4 | MacBook Pro | MacBook Pro |

:green_circle: - Everything supported, tested and working, including stack orchestration.

:yellow_circle: - Almost everything is supported, with only minor things which may not be fully supported.

:orange_circle: - Orchestrating applications and docker stack should work, but not everything is intended for full support.

:red_circle: - No current intended support.

Note that working means within the tool when you run and interact with it.
