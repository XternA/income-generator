**[ Multi-Platform | Docker Stack | Containerized | Passive Income | Auto Update ]**

If you like this project, don't forget to leave a star. ‚≠ê

>**NOTE:** *"This tool has always been developed for my personal use in mind, therefore the focus has always been Linux first as I run them on my home and cloud servers before making it available to the general public."*

## Overview üìö
**Income Generator** is an all-in-one tool that consolidates a variety of supported applications, enabling the ability to generate passive income by leveraging everyday devices and unused internet bandwidth.

By seamlessly integrating these applications, simplifying the entire process, making it more efficient and accessible with applications auto-updating.

Some of the key features you can expect:
- **Easy To Use** - All-in-one solution for managing the stack. Docker installation, start/stop/remove.
- **Multi-platform** - Deploy across different OS.
- **Global Access** - Access the tool anywhere, just type `igm`.
- **Auto update** - Ensures applications always running up-to-date.
- **On-the-fly-update** - Tool can be updated on the fly whilst preserving config settings.
- **Local Config** - Config file is auto-generated and stored locally, including credentials.
- **Resource Limit** - Easily apply resource limit based on system hardware.

üìñ Referring to the [**Wiki**](../../wiki) is strongly recommended for more details and in-depth instructions.

## Getting Started üö•
### Prerequisite üì¶
**The tool configures and runs everything in a containerised virtualised environment isolated from the host.**

- Works best on a 64-bit machine, though it is still possible to run it under a 32-bit operating system (OS), but will will come with certain performance limitations, specifically with lower memory availability.
- A minimum of 4GB would be best recommended to ensure the most resource available and for future expansions.
- The stack requires a more recent version of **Docker**  which bundles **Compose** for orchestrating and running containers.
- For ARM architecture devices, such as Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon etc, will be required to install an emulation layer such as [**qemu-user-static (qus)**](https://github.com/dbhi/qus) to run x86 architecture on ARM. This can be easily enabled via the Docker container which injects it directly.
- For Windows, [**WSL2**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [**Winget**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager) will be required.

Check the [**Prerequisites**](../../wiki/Prerequisites#arm-devices) section for emulation layer setup.

### Quick Start Guide ‚öôÔ∏è
Assuming **Docker** and **Compose** is already pre-installed (Can also be installed from the tool):
>:warning: *Newer versions of Docker integrate Compose directly. Accessed as `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.*

### Windows
![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)

Refer to the [**Windows**](../../wiki/Windows-Host) guide first to ensure prerequisites are met before proceeding. If WSL is already configured, continue.

Open the command line (Run as administrator this one time) and get the bootstrap script.
```markdown
curl -o %windir%\igm.bat --ssl-no-revoke -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XternA/income-generator/main/start.bat
```
Run the tool.
```sh
# Type anywhere in the command line
igm
```

### Linux & macOS
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/MacOS-444444?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=white)

Open the terminal and clone the project.
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/XternA/income-generator.git ~/.income-generator
```
Register alias for global access. (Auto detects and adds to current shell choice e.g. `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` etc.)
```sh
echo "alias igm='(cd ~/.income-generator; sh start.sh)'" >> ~/."${SHELL##*/}"rc; source ~/."${SHELL##*/}"rc
```
Run the tool.
```sh
# Type anywhere in the command line
igm
```

### Register Applications
Register an account for each application in the **[applications table](#app-compatibility-)**. Can also be done from the tool.

## App Compatibility üìã
Using the table below, each app can identify its total install count per IP type. This indicates which stack option to run in the **'Install & Run Applications'** option of the tool.

Each app has been grouped in the install option. Therefore, whether it be residential or hosting already installed in the same network, you can install it on another device within the same network using the selective choice. The tool will install all the apps that meet the conditions below.

## Tested Environments ‚úÖ
The docker stack should work on anything that may have docker installed. In particular, it has been tested on:

| Windows WSL2 (x86_64 / amd64) | Linux Ubuntu (x86_64 / amd64) | Raspbian OS (arm32/64) | Intel macOS (x86_64) | Apple Silicon (arm64) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :green_circle: |
| Desktop / Laptop | Desktop / Laptop | Raspberry Pi 3/4 | MacBook Pro | MacBook Pro |

:green_circle: - Everything supported, tried and tested.

:yellow_circle: - Almost everything is supported. Only minor things which may not be fully supported.

:orange_circle: - Orchestrating applications and docker stack should work, but not everything is intended for full support.

Note that working means within the tool when you run and interact with it.
