**Income Generator** is an all-in-one feature-rich tool that allows generating passive income by leveraging income generating applications and unused internet bandwidth with minimal system resource.

Designed for minimal setup and native cross-platform support, utilizing containerized runtime isolation from the host, with full orchestration allowing fast deployment across multiple hosts.

üìñ It's' strongly recommended to refer to the [**Wiki**](../../wiki) for in-depth details and instructions.

## Key Features ‚ú®
- **Multi-platform** - Deploy across different OS.
- **Global Access** - Access the tool anywhere, just type `igm`.
- **Auto update** - Ensures applications always running up-to-date.
- **On-the-fly-update** - Tool can be updated on the fly whilst preserving config settings.
- **Local Config** - Config file is auto-generated and stored locally, including credentials.
- **Encryption** - Credential secrets are automatically encrypted/decrypted when in operation.
- **Resource Limit** - Easily apply resource limit based on system hardware dynamically.
- **Selective Apps** - Enable or disable the application of your choice to deploy and earn.

## Getting Started üö•
### Prerequisite üì¶
**The tool configures and runs everything in a containerized virtualized environment isolated from the host.**

- A 64-bit machine. It is possible to run on a 32-bit machine, but expect performance or compatibility limitations.
- A minimum of 4GB is recommended to ensure enough resource availability for scaling and future expansion.
- ARM architecture devices, such as Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon, etc, require  an emulation layer such as [**qemu-user-static (qus)**](https://github.com/dbhi/qus) to run x86 architecture applications on ARM. Automatically configured seamlessly through the tool.
- On Windows, [**WSL2**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [**Winget**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager) is required.

### Quick Start Guide ‚öôÔ∏è
If the prerequisites are met based on the platform, you can simply follow the quick start guide, otherwise, refer to the [**Wiki**](../../wiki) for the full setup procedure.

### Windows

Refer to the [**Windows**](../../wiki/Windows-Host) guide first to ensure prerequisites are met before proceeding. If WSL is already configured, continue.

Open the command line and get the bootstrap script.
```markdown
curl -o %APPDATA%\IGM\igm.bat --create-dirs --ssl-no-revoke -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XternA/income-generator/main/start.bat
```
Register the bootstrap script by adding an entry to the environment variable path.
```sh
for /f "delims=" %i in ('powershell -Command "[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User')"') do set USERPATH=%i && setx PATH %USERPATH%;%APPDATA%\IGM
```
For the registering to take effect, close and re-open a new command line process.

Run the tool.
```sh
# Type anywhere in the command line
igm
```
