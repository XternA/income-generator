## Overview üìö
**Income Generator** is an all-in-one tool that allows generating passive income by leveraging popular passive income generative applications, everyday devices, and unused internet bandwidth.

The result is a tool that fully orchestrates, manages, and deploys these applications into an isolated space from the host, simplifying the process, and allowing for fast deployment across stacks with application auto-update management.

**Some of the key features you can expect:**
- **Easy To Use** - All-in-one solution for managing the stack. Docker installation, start/stop/remove.
- **Multi-platform** - Deploy across different OS.
- **Global Access** - Access the tool anywhere, just type `igm`.
- **Auto update** - Ensures applications always running up-to-date.
- **On-the-fly-update** - Tool can be updated on the fly whilst preserving config settings.
- **Local Config** - Config file is auto-generated and stored locally, including credentials.
- **Resource Limit** - Easily apply resource limit based on system hardware.
- **Selective Apps** - Enable or disable the application of your choice to deploy.

üìñ Refer to the [**Wiki**](../../wiki) is strongly recommended for more details and in-depth instructions.

## Getting Started üö•
### Prerequisite üì¶
**The tool configures and runs everything in a containerized virtualized environment isolated from the host.**

- A 64-bit machine, though it's possible to run on a 32-bit machine, but with certain performance limitations, specifically with lower memory availability.
- A minimum of 4GB is recommended to ensure the most resource available and for future expansions.
- ARM architecture devices, such as Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon, etc, require  an emulation layer such as [**qemu-user-static (qus)**](https://github.com/dbhi/qus) to run x86 architecture applications on ARM. Installing docker via the tool will enable this automatically.
- For Windows,  [**WSL2**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [**Winget**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager) will be required.

### Quick Start Guide ‚öôÔ∏è
If the prerequisites are met based on the platform, you can simply follow the quick start guide, otherwise, refer to the [**Wiki**](../../wiki) for the full setup procedure.

### Windows
![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)

Refer to the [**Windows**](../../wiki/Windows-Host) guide first to ensure prerequisites are met before proceeding. If WSL is already configured, continue.

Open the command line and get the bootstrap script.
```markdown
curl -o %APPDATA%\IGM\igm.bat --create-dirs --ssl-no-revoke -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XternA/income-generator/main/start.bat
```
Register the bootstrap script by adding an entry to the environment variable path.
```
for /f "delims=" %i in ('powershell -Command "[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User')"') do set USERPATH=%i && setx PATH %USERPATH%;%APPDATA%\IGM
```
For the registering to take effect, close and re-open a new command line process.

Run the tool.
```sh
# Type anywhere in the command line
igm
```

---
### Linux & macOS

Open the terminal and clone the project.
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/XternA/income-generator.git ~/.income-generator
```
Register alias for global access. (Auto detects and adds to current shell choice e.g. `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` etc.)
```sh
echo "alias igm='(cd ~/.income-generator; sh start.sh)'" >> ~/."${SHELL##*/}"rc; source ~/."${SHELL##*/}"rc
```
Run the tool.
```sh
# Type anywhere in the command line
igm
```

### Register Applications
Register an account for each application in the **[applications table](#app-compatibility-)**. Can also be done from the tool.

## App Compatibility üìã
Using the table below, each app can identify its total install count per IP type. This indicates which stack option to run in the **'Install & Run Applications'** option of the tool.

Each app has been grouped in the install option. Therefore, whether it be residential or hosting already installed in the same network, you can install it on another device within the same network using the selective choice. The tool will install all the apps that meet the conditions below.

- üìã Register via the links below will entitle you to receive a bonus added to your account on registration. Additionally, it ensures you're registering at the correct site and showing your support for my work.
- üîê If using social logins such as Google, be sure to set a password to the account as it will be required for authentication to the app later.
